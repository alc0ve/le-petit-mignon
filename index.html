                    My GitHub name is 'alc0ve' so I figured it was PUNintentional to turn this portfolio into my little corner. Right now, it is my "<i>petit</i>" alcove, but I hope one day it would be my "<i>trÃ¨s magnifique</i>" alcove! 
                    <br></br>Some things about me... I would love to travel more. Especially to France! My dog is my child. She is spoiled and is not afraid to show it. I am fluent in Korean, and I'd also love to go back to Korea. I am a radiation therapist working as a diagnostic x-ray tech. I am the person that makes sure someone's dialysis access sites are working properly, so that when they are on dialysis, it runs smoothly. I ride motorcycles! I have a Yamaha R3, the 60th anniversary GP edition. I used to have a beautiful blue Kawasaki Z400, but wrecked it in the mountains in May.
