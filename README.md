# le-petit-mignon

## Description

This is a portfolio to show my progression in learning how to become a full-stack developer. "Le petit mignon" in french can be translated to "the pretty one" or "the little cutie," which felt appropriate for first time building a webpage on my own. With this portfolio, I learned how to build a basic webpage from scratch, and how there are MANY ways to do ONE thing-- just by using HTML and CSS. ðŸ˜Ž

## Installation

To create this portfolio, I began with a folder, then creating an index.html file which will hold the structure of how I wanted the layout. I used little wireframing to brainstorm some ideas as well. Then once I got the basic structure, I made another folder for my CSS. Then, I created a file-- external style sheet, style.css, to add more personality to the page. I created a header, then made "cards" for the apps I plan on adding later on as I progress in learning web development. As of this moment in place of the apps, it contains images of things I love and enjoy. I added links behind the images for more information and to make it available to those with disabilities, I added description to those images.

## Usage

This page is solely for anybody to use to get to know my journey as I learn web development. Its purpose is also for me to track what I've learned through app cards. I hope it will be "trÃ¨s magnifique" or close to it when the time comes. Currently one can go on the webpage, then click on the photos in the app cards, and learn about things I like.

## Credits

Thanks to Blair, Lacey, Brian, Christina B., and BJ! Love my classmates! They were extremely helpful and the feedback was most needed. I am so blessed to have met you all! I look forward to future projects together! ðŸ˜„

Thank you to my tutor, Brandon Rose, for debugging some weird things in my code-- that background header image, especially. I learned a lot! Thank you also for sticking with me through the deployment process.
