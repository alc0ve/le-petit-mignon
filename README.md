# le-petit-mignon

## Description

This is a portfolio to show my progression in learning how to become a full-stack developer. "Le petit mignon" in french can be translated to "the pretty one" or "the little cutie," which felt appropriate for first time building a webpage on my own. With this portfolio, I learned how to build from scratch, and how there are MANY ways to do ONE thing.

## Installation

To create this portfolio, I began with a folder, then creating an index.html file which will hold the structure of how I wanted the layout. I used little wireframing to brainstorm some ideas as well. Then once I got the basic structure, I made an external style sheet, style.css, to add more personality to the page. I created a header, then made "cards" for the apps I plan on adding later on as I progress in learning web development. As of this moment, in place of the apps, it contains things I love and enjoy. 

## Usage

This page is solely for anybody to use to get to know my journey as I learn web development. Its purpose is also for me to track what I've learned through app cards. I hope it will be "tr√®s magnifique" or close to it when the time comes. Currently, one can go on the webpage, click on the photos in the app cards, and learn about things I like.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

I do want to go back and look at this and later maybe add a few classmates that help me along this journey!

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here. Hopefully, I can fill section with some things later on as my portfolio progresses.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
